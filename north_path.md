# The Princess
As you travel north of the castle, you are greeted by a beautiful princess.

She asks you to help her because a witch put a spell on her kingdom and even poisoned the king and the queen, just so she can rule the kingdom. She offers you to help save the kingdom from the witch, and you say yes.
