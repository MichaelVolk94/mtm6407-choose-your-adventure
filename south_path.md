# The Wizard
You travel south and you meet a wizard in his secret room at the southern tower of the castle. 

You tell the princess on the north side of the castle is trapped under a spell, and she needs his powers to help break the spell and save the kingdom from the evil witch.
The wizard gives you a poisonous dart, as a way to end the witch's treasonous reign of terror.
