# The Witch
As you travel down west, you've finally encounted the great witch! If you are equipped with a poison dose, and a group of knights, then you are ready to fight. 

As the witch makes her first move, you dodge many of the witch's magic powers. One touch of the witch's powers can turn you into stone. As the battle heats up, you are near the witch's grasp, as you manage to knock the witch's wand out of her hand, as she tries to retrieve it, you inject her with the poison dose that was given to you from the wizard, and the spell would be broken.

Congratulations! You've successfully saved the kingdom from the witch!
