# The Witch
As you travel down west, you finally encounter the great witch! You are equipped with a poisonous dart, the army of knights; and you are ready for battle.

As the witch makes her first move, you dodge many of the witch's magic powers. One touch of the witch's powers can turn you to stone. As the battle heats up, you are near the witch's grasp, as you manage to knock the witch's wand out of her hand, as she tries to retrieve it, you inject her with the poison dart that was given to you from the wizard, and the spell would be broken.

Congratulations! You've successfully saved the kingdom from the witch!
